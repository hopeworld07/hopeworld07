### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my name is Yamini
#### I am a Game Developer


I'm Yamini. I do Game Development and 3D modeling. I enjoy working on all kinds of projects and learning along the way. I also enjoy RPA and creative content writing in general. 

My current obsession is with physics engines in Game Development. I am creating a 2D physics engine with C# and testing it with Monogame. I am very intrigued by how we make realistic simulations and tweak them according to demand. 

Skills: C# / C++ / Unreal Engine / Blender / Perforce

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on this page.
